# Optimization-Of-MSDSS-Placement-Using-AIML-and-Python-
MSDSS Optimizer uses Python, Differential Evolution, and Random Forests to find the best substation location with ≤5% losses and proper voltage limits. It uses CIP field data, evaluates power flow, cost, and voltage, and generates heatmaps plus optimal coordinates for reliable substation planning.
